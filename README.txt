thin liquid film is an application written as a front end to ffmpeg to convert and upload videos to a video ipod.  It requires pyqt and ffmpeg.  It also has a dependency on the python bindings for libgpod, although if you don't have this package, you can still convert videos, but you won't be able to upload to your ipod.
